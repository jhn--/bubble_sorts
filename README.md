# bubble_sorts
trying my hand at writing bubble sort from scratch, no references just banging my head against the wall. 

initial version and subsequent changes/improvements/refactors are in the following order -

initial 1. bubble_w_helper.py
        2. bubble_no_helper.py
        3. bubble_for.py
